CSci 4554 Lab 4: Diffie-Hellman key exchange<br />
Due Wednesday, December 5th at 11:59pm<br />
#####Overview and background<br />
This lab is done in groups of 2 or individually.

The purpose of the lab is to implement cryptographic algorithms based on the DLP problem and attacks on them.

####Tasks for the lab

#####Task 1: 20 points total<br />
1) Each group finds a partner group (feel free to form cycles of three groups)
2) Each group generates a Diffie-Hellman public key:<br />
    1) Choose a safe prime p between 10000000 and 1000000000. A safe prime is a prime equal to 2q+1, where q is also a prime. The reason for using a safe prime is so that the group has a very large cyclic subgroup. We will later see how having only small cyclic subgroups makes it much easier to solve the DLP problem.<br /> 
    You will need a first to choose a smaller prime q, then compute 2q+1, and check if it is a prime as well. If it's not, try another q. You may use your own primality checker or methods in BigInteger class.
    2) Find a generator in the cyclic group mod p. To check if a number g is a generator, check that g^2 and g^q are both not equal to 1 (that is because the order of the group is 2q, so it only has cyclic subgroups of the orders 2 and q). This means that g does not belong to any of the cyclic subgroups of p, so it is a generator. 
    A small generator is fine. Use square-and-multiply for your computations and reduce modulo p after each step.<br />
3) Send your p and generator g to your partner group via the discussion on canvas (mark the message with your initials and theirs), then follow the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to generate a shared key (send your A, receive their B).<br />
4) Use email (not the canvas) to verify that you got the same key.<br />
5) Use the p and g sent to you by your partner group to generate another shared key, also check it.

#####Task 2: 20 points total

As you are viewing communications by other groups in the canvas discussion, use any of the methods below to solve their DLP to find their a and b (since your numbers are small, and therefore not really secure, that should be possible).

Apply one the following methods: baby-step, giant-step method or Pollard's rho algorithm, to find a secret key for an DLP problem generated by another group.

#####What to submit

A record of all the steps that you did (computations, postings, etc).<br />
Your genrated keys<br />
All the keys that you broke (and explanation of how you broke them)<br />
All your code.

####Answers for Task 1:
1) Our partner group was AK and KZ
2) To generate the Diffie-Hellman Public key we chose the safe prime p = 35530787 and generator g = 2 (See Main.java)
3) We posted these to the discussion on Canvas
4) We verified privately that the keys we calculated were the same using our p: key = 27705812 
5) We verified privately that the keys we calculated were the same using their p: key = 6192400385
